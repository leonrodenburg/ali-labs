# Alibaba Cloud Labs
Guided labs to get started with Alibaba Cloud. The idea is that you can work your way through the labs from top to bottom to learn how to operate your application in Alibaba Cloud. If you're already familiar with one or more topics you can skip those. The difficulty of the challenges will gradually increase throughout the course. We will start by installing the Alibaba Cloud CLI and performing several common tasks with that. In other labs, you will also get introduced to Terraform (which we will help you install) and the management console (although we avoid too much clicking, as that is hard to reproduce in production).

To get started, make sure you have [Pipenv](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv) installed. Then clone this repository and run `pipenv install` in the directory to install all the necessary dependencies. After that, spawn a Pipenv shell using `pipenv shell`. To start a challenge, `cd` into any of the challenge directories. Read the `README.md` file for hints. Finally, run `python verify.py` to verify your solution! Rinse and repeat for other challenges.

*Note: performing the labs in your own account might incur (small) costs. We will not be able to stay in the free tier, but if you carefully delete every solution when you're done we are talking cents and dollars, not monthly wages.*
